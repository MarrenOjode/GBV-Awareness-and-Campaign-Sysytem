				   <h2>Needs</h2>
                    <p> &#8226; A study by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics showed that 23.6 per cent of Kenyans have witnessed or heard cases of domestic 
					violence in their communities since the introduction of COVID-19 containment measures.</p>

					<p>&#8226; The national GBV Hotline 1195 received 810 cases in September (as of 29 September 2020) compared to 646 cases in August, 
					an increase of 25 per cent. All cases received psychosocial first aid (PFA) and referral services.</p>

					<p>&#8226; A study undertaken by the Ministry of Health and Population Council (April 2020) on COVID-19 Knowledge, Attitudes, Practices and 
					Needs which showed that 39 per cent of women and 32 per cent of men were experiencing tensions in their homes.</p>

					<p>&#8226; About 12,000 women and girls displaced and affected by floods need GBV-related services and psycho social first aid, according 
					to GBV partners.</p>

					<p>&#8226; About 650,000 women and girls in urban informal settlements need access to basic household supplies and dignity kits to reduce
					the risk of GBV.</p>

					<p>&#8226; About 440,000 girls in counties with high prevalence of female genital mutilation (FGM) require social protection and psychosocial 
					support, including dignity kits.<p>

					<p>&#8226; At least 2,350 women and girls across the country need shelters and safe houses for protection from GBV and FGM.</p> <br>

                    <h2>Response</h2>
					<p>&#8226; A total of 530 dignity kits were distributed in Isiolo (100), Nairobi (130), Narok (50), Kajiado (100), Kakamega (100), 
					Meru County (50) and Migori (100) counties.</p>

					<p>&#8226; Field visits we conducted in Kajiado, Kisumu and Kakamega counties to create awareness on SRH and GBV during COVID-19.</p>

					<p>&#8226; Nairobi and Kakamega counties were supported GBV survivors at Feminist Centre and women with disabilities at This Ability. 
					Additionally, humanitarian partners took part in filed visit to support male engagement in addressing FGM in Kajiado County.</p>

					<p>&#8226; A total of 810 GBV cases received by the national GBV Hotline during the month of September 2020. In addition, 
					3,428 people accessed virtual GBV education through the hotline.</p>

					<p>&#8226; At least 5.4 million people reached with messages on GBV through multiple platforms, including webinars, social media, 
					radio stations and print media since May 2020.</p>

					<p>&#8226; At least 9,528 men in nomadic counties of Marsabit, Wajir, Mandera, Isiolo and Migori were reached with advocacy messages
					on GBV prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

					<p>&#8226; Sustained six tele-counsellors to support county GBV hotlines in Kwale, Kilifi and Mombasa, which have been set up 
					by the county governments.</p>

					<p>&#8226; Five shelters (four in Nairobi, one in Mombasa) were assessed and contracted for support to survivors of GBV and are now
					operational. The shelters are offering accommodation, psychosocial support, pro bono legal services and provision of dignity kits to
					the survivors.</p>

					<p>&#8226; A total of 30 SGBV survivors (27 female and three males) were supported to access pro-bono legal aid services.

					<h2>Gaps</h2>
					<p>&#8226; At least 3,000 health care workers and 1,500 police officers still need orientation on GBV and female genital mutilation.</p>

					<p>&#8226; Access to justice has been a challenge as the court system is not operating fully.</p>

					<p>&#8226; Reluctance by many survivors to officially report violations citing fear of repeated violence as due to uncertainty from 
					enforcement actors.</p>

					<p>&#8226; Inadequate access to sanitary wear for over 1.2 million girls especially in rural locations and urban informal settlements.</p>

					<p>&#8226; Access to justice was hindered for some survivors of SGBV i.e. use of traditional court system to settle cases hindered
					justice to women and girls in the North Eastern region. Communities preferred Maslaha System to the Courts.</p>
