                    <p> The objective of this program is to improve services provision and community awareness of services for survivors of sexual assault 
					in Kenya, which struggles with one of the highest rates of gender-base violence in the world.</p><br>
					
					<p>In this rapidly-changing world, disadvantaged children face increasing marginalisation. All our work will focus on reaching vulnerable
					and excluded children, particularly girls, where their rights are most violated. Children are living on city streets, in slums and in 
					villages, or migrating to seek safety, opportunity or shelter. We must be where they are and enable them to realise their rights.</p><br>
					
					<p>To create awareness and transform the lives of children and girls, we will strengthen our influence at all levels: from communities to global 
					organisations. We will use knowledge gained through our work to push for better solutions to poverty and real progress in gender
					equality.</p><br>

                    <p> GBV Campaign‘s primary prevention focuses on creating awareness that facilitates behavior change. Target groups are engaged through community 
					and media awareness initiatives as well as innovative child participatory processes. The campaign builds the capacities for service providers 
					on GBV management and the community through trainings and would share community approaches in regards to prevention of GBV with health facilities, 
					Corporate, Police, Judiciary and School communities through the Teachers’ Service Commission. GVRC has a strong partnership with the 
					National Police Service through capacity enhancement (on forensic management, GBV reporting, documentation), referrals and expert 
					testimonies in court.<br><br>
					The GBV Campaign together with GVRC have trained police officers country wide to manage gender friendly desks at their assigned police stations. 
					Through the trainings done in East Africa, there has been a representative from the police working under child protection and GBV. 
					Results have been recorded with Kilimani police station in Kenya, Kawempe Police Station in Uganda as the two units have separate section to 
					deal with children issues and improved quality of interventions as a result of the capacity enhancement trainings.</p><br>

                    <p>The world is changing – and so are we. We have adopted the theory of change and strategy
					that stretch our global ambition to contribute to reaching the Sustainable Development Goals. We have put gender equality and the 
					persistent development challenges that girls are facing right at the heart of our organisational purpose.  </p><br>
					
					<p>Drawing on more than 2 years of experience and programme evidence and connecting to the lives of millions of children, youth and 
					communities around the world, our advocacy targets changes to policies, resource allocation, legislation, institutions and practices
					so that both current and future generations can realise their rights and fulfil their potential.</p>

                    <div class="text" style="color:brown; font-size:25px">OUR MISSION </div>
					
                    <p> Modern life is increasingly driven by technology and digital tools can provide effective solutions to the issues faced by the world’s
					most vulnerable people in the society especially women and children.</p><br>
					
					<p>Technology also plays a key role in international development. While the digital revolution has not advanced at an equal pace across
					the world and marginalised groups continue to be excluded, the introduction of new tools has brought improvements. </p><br>

					<p>Vital health information has been shared via SMS messages, radio has been used to educate people about issues like child marriage 
					and television has been an effective medium for sharing information about social change.</p><br>

					<p>When used smartly, technology can offer us new ways to address the challenges faced by children. We can make our work more 
					efficient and more transparent with digital data collection and analytics, and we can ensure the voices of marginalised people 
					reach decision makers and leaders everywhere.</p>
